<h3>Website Design Process:</h3>
<p>
The Homepage image are actually different images of examples of web art from the internet but sadly they did not show the artists and there are 
different images and the colour palette of these art pieces match the style guide of the website. I made these internet artworks into one 
big piece altogether.
Looking at the first colour palette of the style guide. The first option was lilac, for the background which was a soft purple but I felt
as if the soft purple with the black header was a bit unprofessional mixed with the first font and decided to go with a soft pink as the background.
At first I experimented with dark red but the red was conflicting with the black font and changing the font into white might be a bit distracting to 
viewers so soft pink felt like a safe colour which would not conflict with the fonts of the website. This soft pink helped compliment the website with
the neutral font colours such as black and white. I changed the text align to make the blog post section more neat and polished.

The Links for my pages were selected in that order because of the information on the module section about internet art how we will be applying it our websites.
Some links are still process as some of the links are not yet briefed for example, the Art Gallery and Contact Section.

<h2>Reference Material for Website:</h2>

<h3>Reference Material Explanation:</h3>
<p>
According to colour psychology, different colours have a different representation and effect in terms of branding.
The colour pink represents compassion, softness and creativity. I thought it would be fitting since the website focuses
on different aspects of internet art including internet art blog posts such as web net and the design section showing
the design process. It is used for the background colour to show a bit of softness and safety for the viewers and creativity.
The colour black is seen as professional, elegance and a symbol of power. It was chosen for the header to give off a sense of professionalism
and elegance as well as compliment the softness of the pink background. It is also seen as formal as it gives this view for the website.
The black font is commonly used for articles and paragraphs in websites.
The colour white represents calmness, neatiness and tidiness. This colour was selected for the header font links to show the tidiness of the website
and viewers are able to see the links clearly and the colour does not conflict with any colours in the website.
Lastly the colour purple which is seen when selecting different links in the header have a different colour psychological view 
on the website as the professionalism of this colour shows luxury, ambition and confidence.
