<h2>Week2: Web Art</h2>
<article>
<p>
This analysis uses the critical and theoretical work to analyze the following web art. The artwork that I have chosen is from Rhizome’s website about the net art anthology. The artwork is called the simple net art diagram. According to the readings on the work of art has two different representations of visual artworks. (Rhizome, n.d.) The artwork on the website, represents the ability for artwork to be shown in different technology including laptops and shows the cord is where all artwork gets transferred. (Rhizome, n.d.). The only way to see artwork nowadays is online, including artistic events such as art exhibitions in galleries and museums online. You can do this without leaving your studies or leave your desk. (Carrier, 2020). Visual artworks on the internet do not have an aura but this aura is replaced with effective replacements of multiple copies of the original artwork. (Carrier, 2020). An example of this is the access that the internet gives us to the seeing different famous artworks such as the Mona Lisa, Van Gogh’s Starry Night, and other famous masterpieces. The main page of Rhizome has other visual artworks whereas the previous website I mentioned has more of an explanation on how net art is available on the internet. The main page provides different artworks by different artists for viewers to see and discover. An example of artwork from the website is an artwork called Amorphoscapes II by Stanza which was created in 1997. The artwork series was active from 1997-2004. The artworks were touch screen editions. These artworks remind me of the art style Vincent Van Gogh incorporated into his famous art pieces specifically in his backgrounds of these art pieces. (Stanza, 1997). Internet art is considered a new visual art form that has been created. This website is an example of an internet galleries collecting different artworks. (Carrier, 2020). The internet is now a new home for artistic criticism. Commentaries are now available for artwork and can be posted for the artist and others to view.
According to Danae, the web has an influence in the art world because the internet now has a huge impact in our daily lives. It has the importance of internet culture and artistic creation. Post internet art has a sister phrase which is called “art after the internet” that helps find what stands out on the internet. Since the production are pieces, she considers standing out. For the Rhizome website different art pieces on the website will only stand out depending on different people who view because everyone is different. Different pieces will feel different or catch the attention of different viewers. There is a new phase of internet art associated with aesthetics which in these days are popular on social media for artists and creatives as they create whatever they are feeling and incorporate in different artistic ways. Aesthetics are kind of like a theme and there are various options to choose from. Aesthetics in this phrase according to the reading merges the virtual and physical style of the internet.  Aesthetics in this case also refers to a subject and their visual outlook. Aesthetics has reviewed the internet with the rhizomatic structure it possesses. (Danae & Chatel, 2019)

<h2>Week6: Internet, Society And Design Justice</h2>
<article>
    <p>
        In this summary we will be discussing the readings about internet, society, and design as well as a reflection of these three topics. Firstly, we will be discussing the topic about the Internet using readings. The reading for the Internet topic will be The Need for Global Internet Connectivity. The internet can be found in physical locations, and it can bring different people together as well as contact people with loved ones. It helps people find different businesses that specializes in their interests and needs. You can also discover different places with the internet using Google and Chrome. Although isolation is a problem in terms of socializing and preventing cultures from being recognized from the rest of the world. But there are areas such as rural areas that do not have access to the internet and suffer from this type of isolation. (Daniolou, 2020). In my opinion the 2020 lockdown did make a large amount of people use technology to access the internet and contact their loved ones by using apps such as WhatsApp and Instagram in order to message and video call people they could not see physically. But those living in rural areas had limited access to contact their loved ones without specific technology.
        There are several governments and private companies and non-governments and organizations that use the internet as an opportunity to advertise their businesses. In terms of businesses, the internet has a positive effect on the economy, the education, the businesses, and healthcare of those who live in the rural areas. Therefore, the internet can be used as marketing business ventures that help and supply those who do not have access or knowledge of the internet. As technology is always developing therefore the rural internet access will evolve along with it. (Daniolou, 2020). The internet is used as a form of online communication which can be used for an emergency to those who are living far away from each other. The emergency can be emotional or physical crisis. There are advantages to the internet such as google search, mobile libraries and broadband users can of course learn about news, fashion, politics, and science. There are no restrictions. (Daniolou, 2020). Although the internet has great power there is also dangers to the internet which can do more harm than good. Online information can be misleading, and the population can be manipulative for example, misleading articles about a politic topic or a certain celebrity the reason for these actions towards the media is that it will give more attention to the media brand as well as get people to view their website. This is considered “clout chasing” or “clickbait” in this generation where articles or people on the internet mislead people in order to get attention even if it means damaging someone’s reputation or career. It also has a harm towards social groups by those who pretend to be something they are not in order to kidnap young girls and women which is seen in the dark web and Tinder Swindler. (Daniolou, 2020). I believe that parents should be aware and keep their children aware of the dangers of the internet as well as having a parental view to see if they are not doing anything that will get their children victims to dangerous people on the internet.
        As for society we will be using the reading by Tataki and Glynos. The reading begins with the mentioning of students that had to adapt to the global pandemic and how some children were not able to attend physical classes by 50%. The solution for the absence of children in classroom while attending online classes were platforms such as Funzi. In our case their apps such as Teams and uLwazi which helped students that attend online classes. It also makes it easy for those students’ who live in different provinces. These applications helped with having contacting teachers and made it easier for students to contact their teachers when having a problem although it took some time to adjust. In my opinion online learning has now become a normal part of today’s society as we had to adapt to the global pandemic. Even aside from online learning there are some jobs where people are having meetings online rather than face to face just to be safe and some companies are still strict on the Covid-19 protocols. But there are still disadvantages for high income countries as their children have to adapt with the web application especially when they are not used to it. For example, there were students with courses that did not require a laptop at first until the pandemic and were struggling to adapt or afford one. Some universities managed to make applications for those who did not have computers at home. (Tataki & Glynos, 2020). The next topic is about design and in my opinion the design department is important in business companies because without design there is no advertisement which will catch the attention of the businesses target audience and target market. Designers are responsible for brand logos, websites and advertisements which help with recognition of the brand and help target audiences become well known. Design justice is seen as a framework that recognizes that design is a human activity. Design is about making a plan, problem solving and making a mark. The reading mentions the sexism in the workplace where professional design jobs are given to males than females. Professional design jobs in different work fields are allocated to people with high located privileges. Designers are highly rewarded both culturally and economically. There are different designers that are people of colour that are not fully recognized. (Costanza-Chock, 2020)
