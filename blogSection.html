<h2>Week2: Web Art</h2>
<article>
<p>
This analysis uses the critical and theoretical work to analyze the following web art. The artwork that I have chosen is from Rhizome’s website about the net art anthology. The artwork is called the simple net art diagram. According to the readings on the work of art has two different representations of visual artworks. (Rhizome, n.d.) The artwork on the website, represents the ability for artwork to be shown in different technology including laptops and shows the cord is where all artwork gets transferred. (Rhizome, n.d.). The only way to see artwork nowadays is online, including artistic events such as art exhibitions in galleries and museums online. You can do this without leaving your studies or leave your desk. (Carrier, 2020). Visual artworks on the internet do not have an aura but this aura is replaced with effective replacements of multiple copies of the original artwork. (Carrier, 2020). An example of this is the access that the internet gives us to the seeing different famous artworks such as the Mona Lisa, Van Gogh’s Starry Night, and other famous masterpieces. The main page of Rhizome has other visual artworks whereas the previous website I mentioned has more of an explanation on how net art is available on the internet. The main page provides different artworks by different artists for viewers to see and discover. An example of artwork from the website is an artwork called Amorphoscapes II by Stanza which was created in 1997. The artwork series was active from 1997-2004. The artworks were touch screen editions. These artworks remind me of the art style Vincent Van Gogh incorporated into his famous art pieces specifically in his backgrounds of these art pieces. (Stanza, 1997). Internet art is considered a new visual art form that has been created. This website is an example of an internet galleries collecting different artworks. (Carrier, 2020). The internet is now a new home for artistic criticism. Commentaries are now available for artwork and can be posted for the artist and others to view.
According to Danae, the web has an influence in the art world because the internet now has a huge impact in our daily lives. It has the importance of internet culture and artistic creation. Post internet art has a sister phrase which is called “art after the internet” that helps find what stands out on the internet. Since the production are pieces, she considers standing out. For the Rhizome website different art pieces on the website will only stand out depending on different people who view because everyone is different. Different pieces will feel different or catch the attention of different viewers. There is a new phase of internet art associated with aesthetics which in these days are popular on social media for artists and creatives as they create whatever they are feeling and incorporate in different artistic ways. Aesthetics are kind of like a theme and there are various options to choose from. Aesthetics in this phrase according to the reading merges the virtual and physical style of the internet.  Aesthetics in this case also refers to a subject and their visual outlook. Aesthetics has reviewed the internet with the rhizomatic structure it possesses. (Danae & Chatel, 2019)
